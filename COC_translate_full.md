># VATSIM Code Of Conduct

# VATSIM会员行为准则  

>VATSIM is an online community created for enthusiasts of flight simulation and air traffic control. One of the main goals of VATSIM is to create an environment which is fun and, at the same time, educational and a realistic simulation of procedures followed by pilots and air traffic controllers everyday around the world. To further these goals, members of VATSIM must comply with the following Code of Conduct. This Code sets forth how members are expected to conduct themselves.  

VATSIM是一个服务于模拟飞行及模拟管制爱好者的在线社区，致力于打造出一个有趣，并且同时不乏教育意义，以及对真实中世界各地的飞行员和管制员们日常工作模拟的平台。为此，VATSIM要求其会员务必遵守以下行为准则。  

>VATSIM does not care to engage in the constant policing of its Members. If a problem should arise online between two or more Members which cannot be resolved by the parties in a quick manner or if it affects the enjoyment of VATSIM by other Members or could hinder the operation of the network, the parties involved should check to see if a Supervisor or an Administrator is online to help resolve the matter.  

VATSIM不希望对其会员进行持续性的监管。为此，当会员之间在连线过程中发生了冲突或摩擦时，如果各方当事人无法在当下快速处理，或者这些冲突或摩擦会导致其他会员无法正常的使用或享受这个平台时，当事人应当寻求在线的监察员或行政人员的帮助。  

>Note: VATSIM Administrators and Supervisors acting in furtherance of their duties are exempt from certain sections of this Code of Conduct as defined by Supervisor Department Policies.  

注意：根据VATSIM监察部门的规定，行政人员及监察员可在履行其职责时免于遵守本行为准则的部分条款。

B4 - 除被管制员要求外，飞行员

>B5 - Pilots flying through uncontrolled airspace shall monitor VHF radio frequency 122.800 or other designated "UNICOM" frequency until they come under air traffic control coverage. Where another pilot may benefit, a pilot shall transmit their intentions on the designated unicom frequency.  

>B6 - No flight may declare itself to have priority over another. Pilots are permitted to declare in-flight emergencies only when under air traffic control. If, for any reason, air traffic control requests the pilot to terminate the emergency, then the pilot must do so IMMEDIATELY or disconnect from the network. Pilots are not permitted to simulate any unlawful act including, but not limited to, declaring a hijack by any method, including entering a transponder code of 7500.  

>B7 - Two or more pilots are permitted to fly in formation. If, for any reason, air traffic control instructs pilots to separate, the pilots must immediately comply with the request or disconnect from the network.  

>B8 - A pilot must comply with all agreed (read-back) air traffic control clearances and all issued instructions, or notify air traffic control without delay if unable to do so. Additionally, compliance with the following ATC instructions is mandatory, unless operational safety (e.g. TCAS conflict resolution) is compromised:  

>- Holding position when on the ground at an airport.  

>- Flying at a speed.  

>- Flying a heading.  

>- Flying at an altitude or flight level.  



>B9 - A pilot operating their simulator using acceleration/deceleration functions must continuously monitor their connection, and ensure that they do not cause disruptions to other members. If operating in actively controlled airspace, the pilot must have the express permission of the controller to operate using time acceleration/deceleration, and if a controller requests a pilot to return to ‘normal simulation rate’, the pilot shall immediately comply.  

>B10 - All pilots flying IFR shall submit a flight plan before flight. The IFR flight plan must contain, at a minimum, the aircraft callsign, departure airport, arrival airport, aircraft type, and requested route. All VFR pilots are encouraged, when appropriate, to submit a flight plan.  

>B11 - Pilots may fly together through the use of a shared cockpit function. When pilots fly together through the use of a shared cockpit function, members are jointly liable for any infringement of VATSIM Policies.

>C1 - Controllers who are new to VATSIM, or are otherwise unfamiliar with an airspace shall educate themselves by first observing operations and/or studying procedures used in that location.  

>C2 - Controllers shall follow local rules and procedures. Controllers who choose to work in locations other than their requested and assigned location must follow the local rules and procedures at that location, and must be approved to control as a ‘visiting controller’ where required by local policy. Visiting controller status is governed by the Transfer and Visiting Controllers Policy (https://www.vatsim.net/documents/transf ... ler-policy)  

>C3 - When logging onto the VATSIM Network as an observer, a member shall use a callsign which ends as follows: "_OBS". Prior to the underscore an individual shall use their initials or a locally accepted observer format. Other observer callsign formats designating an official network staff role are approved. An observer shall observe only and not communicate on any open text or voice frequency, or provide air traffic control services.  

>C4 - VATSIM recognizes the following suffixes for air traffic control positions. A member shall only use the corresponding facility type when connecting.  

>a. DEL - (Clearance) Delivery

>c. TWR - Tower Control  

>d. DEP - Departure Control  

>e. APP - Approach Control

>g. FSS - Flight Service Station  

>NOTE: Approved Flight Service Stations are specified in Appendix B of the VATSIM Global Rating Policy (http://www.vatsim.net/documents/global-ratings-policy)  


>C5 - Positions are occupied on a "first come" basis. Local facilities, with Division approval, may implement a procedure to book or schedule a controlling time within reasonable limits. Additionally, should a controller lose their connection to the VATSIM Network and return within a reasonable time period to find their position taken by another controller, the second controller shall relinquish the position to the original controller.  

>C6 - Only approved positions and their corresponding frequencies may be opened by controllers. Controllers may only open a position they are authorized to, in accordance with global and local policy. See the Global Ratings Policy (https://www.vatsim.net/documents/global-ratings-policy) and the Transfer and Visiting Controller Policy (https://www.vatsim.net/documents/transf ... ler-policy) for more information.  

>C7 - A controller may make one additional connection to the VATSIM Network to provide an airport voice ATIS at facilities which have an ATIS in real life. There must be an accompanying text version, which shall always be in English. The ATIS shall be formatted in accordance with the ATC Frequency Management and Information Policy (https://www.vatsim.net/air-traffic-control-frequency-and-information-management-policy).  

>C8 - Controllers shall set an appropriate visibility range for their position. The maximum ranges for a given position are as follows:  

>Observers: 300 Nautical Miles  

>Clearance Delivery:20 Nautical Miles  

>Ground Control:20 Nautical Miles  

>Tower Control:50 Nautical Miles  

>Approach Control:150 Nautical Miles  

>Departure Control:150 Nautical Miles  

>Enroute (Center) Control:600 Nautical Miles  

>FSS Control: 1500 Nautical Miles  

>Controllers shall not set visibility ranges higher than the maximum ranges set forth above unless they have prior written approval from the VATSIM.net Board of Governors, or the Executive Committee.  


>Epilogue - Remember, the primary goals of VATSIM are to educate, to provide a realistic simulation of flying and air traffic control and, most importantly, to provide a fun environment for everyone to enjoy our hobby. By following the simple rules set forth in this Code of Conduct, everyone is ensured of learning and making new friends from around the world. To all our new members, welcome! Enjoy!
